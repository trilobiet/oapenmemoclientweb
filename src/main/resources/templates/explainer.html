			<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
			
			<p>After signing in, a single page is shown listing the most recent versions of all Task exports for which the 
				<strong>startDate</strong> has passed. Click on the links to view or download the files.</p>
				
			<p>As soon as the Task Manager generates a new report it will be listed here, overwriting any previous version.</p>
			
			<p>When a chain icon ðŸ”— appears in the &#39;public link&#39; column, the associated link is intended for public 
				use and can be copied safely to other pages on the Internet.</p>

			<h2 id="access-to-resources">Access to resources</h2>
			
			<p>Access to this website is only for authorized users. Accounts (username + password) can only be created 
				and managed by an administrator. Please contact your administrator when you need a new password.</p>
				
			<p>Resources (exported files resulting from tasks being run) are available without authentication, but access 
				to them can be restricted using an access key. Access restrictions on a resource can be used to allow third 
				party applications knowing the key to request the resource, without making the resource public.</p>
				
			<p>Whether access to a resource is restricted is decided by the administrator, who also generates the access keys.</p>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>
					<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">âš </span>
					MEMO Customers should be careful not to share the access key nor publish links containing the access key.
				</strong></p>
				<p>The access key is defined on the client level, not the task level. Once a client&#39;s key is compromised, 
					it will grant access to <strong>all</strong> exports for that client.</p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>In order to request an access restricted resource, the access key must be appended to the request:</p>
			
			<pre><code>https://memo.oapen.org/file/ABC_Corp/a_private_file.json?key=4fdd4c3c0eff4aed8a029d9b9638fe77</code></pre>
			
			<p>Not access restricted resources can be requested without an access key:</p>
			
			<pre><code>https://memo.oapen.org/file/ABC_Corp/a_public_file.json</code></pre>
			
			<p>Attempts to request an access restricted file without a key will be answered with a 
				<strong>401 Unauthorized</strong> response status code.</p>
